              The Power Automate flow for dataset update requests demonstrates significant success in enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Version 1 achieved a {metricsV1.successRate}% success rate with {summaryV1.successful} successful runs, though activity was inconsistent, with notable peaks on April 30 (218 runs) and May 2 (149 runs). Version 2 improved consistency, with {summaryV2.successful} successful runs and a {metricsV2.successRate}% success rate, showing steady activity from May 11 to May 30, 2025. The low failure (V1: {summaryV1.failed}, V2: {summaryV2.failed}) and cancellation (V1: {summaryV1.cancelled}, V2: {summaryV2.cancelled}) counts indicate reliable performance. This analysis underscores the flow's effectiveness, supporting its value in your RBA and project management portfolio as you transition to an application-based interface.
